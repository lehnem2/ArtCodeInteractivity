## Final Project

### Goals:

1. New or Extend?
2. Polish

#### 1. New or Extend?
Quickly decide if you're going to create a new project or build on a previous assignment. Go with something that has the most interest for you. Our schedule was shortened for this project, so be particularly aware of how much time is remaining and what seems reasonable to complete. Ask if unsure.

#### 2. Polish
Consider the viewer's or participant's experience with the artwork. What kinds of things can be done to enhance the experience you want to convey? What details can be implemented to make the overall experience more professional: fullscreen graphics, cables secured/hidden, code stability, etc. Work on having a finished project, ready of gallery display or performance, for this last assignment.
